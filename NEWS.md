## Version 1.2.1

Minor changes for code optimization


## Version 1.2.0

The function \code{Esti_Gram_Charlier}, to compute a Gram-Charlier approximation for a multivariate density has been introduced. 

New functions \code{indx_Commutator_Mixing} and \code{indx_Commutator_Moment}, avoiding use of (large) matrices have been introduced.

The codes of the following functions have been modified in order to get faster computing time: \code{Esti_MRSz_Kurt};  \code{Esti_Skew_Variance_Th}; \code{Esti_Kurt_Variance_Th}; \code{distr_Uni_EVSK_Th}; \code{distr_Uni_MomCum_Th} and \code{Hermite_N_Cov_X1_X2}.

## Version 1.1.1

Dependence on package primes has been removed
